# Junxion UX

Integrating client and server Web UIs using modern Web Components for
lightweight Web UIs.

This project provides a strongly typed, SQL-friendly, junior-safe fluent HTML
system for Deno that works across server and browser environments, with
automatic hypermedia integration using JunxionUX semantics. It is designed for
teams that want to generate HTML deterministically on the server, enhance it
progressively in the browser, and avoid ad-hoc DOM manipulation or string
templating.

The core idea is simple: the same fluent mental model applies everywhere, but
the implementation is environment-specific and intentionally constrained so that
developers cannot “do the wrong thing.”

⚠️ Test cases use bundled JS while the e2e test uses on-demand bundling. This
allows us to test both ways.

To test:

```bash
$ deno task bundle:client                # used by unit tests, not needed by counter/server.ts
$ deno task test                         # runs Deno unit tests
$ ./support/assurance/counter/server.ts  # e2e test
```

TODO:

- [ ] Add bundling of `lib/html/hypermedia.ts`
- [ ] Add deno task git-pre-commit to do "local CI/CD"

## Purpose and design goals

On the server side, the library generates HTML strings safely and
deterministically. Text is escaped by default, raw HTML requires explicit
opt-in, attributes are ordered deterministically, and every HTML tag is exposed
as a named function. There is no generic `el()` exported, so junior developers
are guided into correct usage automatically.

On the browser side, the library creates real DOM nodes using the same fluent
API shape. It adds automatic discovery of JunxionUX `data-*` attributes so that
interactive behavior can be wired up without manual JavaScript glue code.

Between the two, JunxionUX provides a small, opinionated hypermedia vocabulary
inspired by modern HATEOAS patterns. The server emits attributes. The browser
runtime observes them and activates behavior. No hand-written event listeners,
no duplicated logic, no fragile conventions.

## Working natively with AI

The `ai-context.ts` script is a small, deterministic utility that emits a fresh
AI-ready context for the project to STDOUT. It is intended to be run on demand,
typically via a Deno task, to generate a concise but complete prompt that an AI
assistant can use as ground truth for reasoning about the codebase. The script
starts with a brief, stable description of the project and then appends the full
contents of a curated list of relevant files, in a fixed order, with normalized
line endings to ensure reproducible output. Because the output is written to
STDOUT, it can be redirected to a file or piped directly into other tools. In
practice, you add or remove paths in the `FILES` array to control what the AI
sees, then run `deno run -A ai-context.ts` (optionally with `--root` or
`--no-hash`) whenever you want to regenerate an up-to-date AI context that
accurately reflects the current state of the project.

## Directory structure

The repository is split explicitly by environment and responsibility.

`lib/html/shared.ts` file contains shared types and utilities used by both
server and browser implementations. It defines things like attribute types,
child flattening, HTML escaping, and the `raw()` opt-in escape hatch. Nothing in
here depends on DOM or server APIs.

`lib/html/server/fluent.ts` is the server-side fluent HTML builder. It produces
HTML strings. All HTML tags are exported as named functions. Hypermedia helpers
live here as `JunxionUX`, which emits `data-*` attributes but never executes
behavior. This file is safe to use in HTTP handlers, background jobs, static
site generation, or tests.

`lib/html/server/fluent_test.ts` are pure unit tests for server-side HTML
generation. These validate escaping, attribute ordering, void elements, raw HTML
behavior, and JunxionUX attribute emission. No server is started here.

`lib/html/server/fluent-integration_test.ts` are lightweight integration tests
that spin up an ephemeral `Deno.serve()` instance inside the test process. These
tests verify that real HTTP responses contain the expected hypermedia attributes
and that SSE responses behave correctly. There is no external server to run.

`lib/html/browser-ua/fluent.ts` is the browser-side ("browser user agent")
fluent implementation, written in TypeScript and using DOM APIs. This mirrors
the server API shape but returns `HTMLElement` instances instead of strings. It
also includes the JunxionUX runtime logic that auto-discovers `data-*`
attributes and activates behavior.

`src/html/browser-ua/fluent.ts` is the source version of the browser fluent
implementation. This file is not served directly. It exists to be bundled.

`lib/html/browser-ua/fluent.auto.js` is the bundled ("auto"), browser-ready
output generated via `deno bundle`. This file is what you actually serve to
browsers. It contains no TypeScript, no imports, and no build-time dependencies.

`lib/html/browser-ua/fluent_test.html` is the browser test harness. It loads
PicoCSS from a CDN, loads the bundled browser fluent runtime, exercises tag
creation and integration behavior, and reports results directly in the DOM. No
third-party test frameworks are used.

## How server-side usage works

On the server, you import the fluent builder and generate HTML as data, not as
templates.

Example:

```ts
import * as H from "@netspective-labs/junxion-ux/html/server/fluent";

const page = H.doctype() +
  H.html(
    H.head(
      H.title("Example"),
    ),
    H.body(
      H.button(
        { ...H.JunxionUX.clickGet("/ping") },
        "Ping",
      ),
    ),
  );

return new Response(page, {
  headers: { "content-type": "text/html; charset=utf-8" },
});
```

Important properties of this approach:

- All HTML is generated by functions, not string concatenation
- Text is escaped by default
- Interactive behavior is described declaratively using attributes
- No JavaScript logic is embedded in HTML

## How browser-side usage works

In the browser, you serve the bundled runtime and let it enhance the DOM.

Example HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script type="module" src="./fluent.auto.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button data-on:click="@get(&quot;/ping&quot;)">Ping</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

What happens at runtime:

- The JunxionUX runtime scans the DOM
- It discovers `data-on:*` attributes
- It automatically wires the appropriate behavior
- No manual event listeners are required

If you use the browser fluent API directly, it looks like this:

```js
import { button, JunxionUX, mount } from "./fluent.auto.js";

const node = button(
  { ...JunxionUX.clickGet("/ping") },
  "Ping",
);

mount(document.body, node);
```

## How server and browser integrate

The server never knows about the browser runtime, and the browser never imports
server code.

Integration happens purely through HTML and attributes:

- The server emits `data-*` attributes using JunxionUX helpers
- The browser runtime observes and interprets those attributes
- Communication uses standard web mechanisms: fetch, headers, SSE

This means:

- You can view pages with JavaScript disabled
- You can progressively enhance without rewriting templates
- You can reason about behavior from the HTML alone

## Bundling and development workflow

The browser runtime is bundled using:

```bash
deno task bundle:client
```

That output is committed and served directly. No runtime build step is required
in production.

Tests are run with:

```bash
deno test -A
```

Browser tests are opened directly in a browser:

```
http://localhost:8000/lib/html/browser-ua/fluent_test.html
```

## `src` vs. `lib`

The separation between `src` and `lib` is intentional:

- `src` contains code that must be transformed
- `lib` contains code that can be used or served as-is
- Server code never depends on browser APIs
- Browser code never depends on server APIs

This keeps the system auditable, understandable, and difficult to misuse,
especially for junior developers.
