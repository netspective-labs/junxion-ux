# Junxion UX Guide

## TODO

- [ ] Generate learn_test.ts which imports all runnable code and just does a
      "smoke test" by starting each server and using Playwright to hit test
      pages.
- [ ] Add unified learning UX which acts as a guide through all the code

## Prompt

- Use AI to generate `learn.ts` which a outer frame that lists all the examples
  and directories in an inner iframe.
- Use AI to generate README.md in each `learn` directory asking AI to summarize
  what's being demonstrated.
- Use AI to generate JSDoc module headers for each learning example.

These learning guides are for humans but more importantly they are specs for AI.
